SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROJECT

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning algorithms. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. This project uses Python and several libraries to preprocess text data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

OVERVIEW

Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social media sentiment. By analyzing text data from various sources, we can gain insights into how people feel about certain topics, products, or events.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED

NumPy and pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting text data.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as stopwords removal and text tokenization.
